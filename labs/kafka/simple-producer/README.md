# SIMPLE PRODUCER

A laboratory for studying:

- Basic Kafka configuration
- Message production using **Spring Kafka**

A **docker-compose.yml** is provided to run the environment.

To consume all messages, use:

```
scripts/test/run-cons-messages.sh
```

Without a Spring consumer — production only.
